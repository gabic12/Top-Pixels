This application analyzes an image and displays the most frequently appearing colors. It was created with Python v3.13.

To run the app, execute main.py. By default, it processes the dots.jpg image and displays the 10 most frequently occurring colors - if you want to change the image or the number of colors, you can do this by modifying IMAGE_NAME and NUMBER_OF_COLORS variables.
